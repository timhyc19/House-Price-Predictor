# House-Price-Predictor

The following program uses **Python**, **Matplotlib**, **Numpy**, **Sympy**, **Pandas**,and **sci-kit** to predict house prices in the city of Boston. 

I implemented a **_multivariable linear regression model_** to forecast house prices. This method, also known as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several parameter variables to predict an outcome of a response variable. In this case, I extracted several variables from the dataset, including house prices, crime rates, age, proximity to water, tax, and more, to make my model more accurate. Additionally, I take into account issues like _Multicollinearity_ in linear regression, to make sure my program is as precise as possible. 

Below is a model to demonstrate the different correlations between the variables in the dataset.
